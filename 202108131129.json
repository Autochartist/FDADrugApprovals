Shake the bottle well before each use. Measure each dose carefully using the attached measuring cup.

Drink plenty of fluids and minerals (electrolytes) to replace what is lost. Tell your doctor right away if you develop signs of dehydration (e.g., extreme thirst, decreased urination, muscle cramps, weakness, fainting). You may also need to change to a bland diet during this time to reduce irritation to your stomach/intestines. Consult your doctor or pharmacist for more information.Tell your doctor if your diarrhea does not improve after 2 days, if your condition worsens, or if you develop new symptoms. If you develop blood in the stool, fever, or an uncomfortable fullness/swelling of the stomach/abdomen, or if you think you may have a serious medical problem, seek immediate medical attention.If you are taking this medication under your doctor's direction for ongoing diarrhea, tell your doctor if your diarrhea continues after 10 days of treatment."

However, certain situations cause your body to lose magnesium faster than you can replace it from your diet. These situations include treatment with \"water pills\" (diuretics such as furosemide, hydrochlorothiazide), a poor diet, alcoholism, or other medical conditions (e.g., severe diarrhea/vomiting, stomach/intestinal absorption problems, poorly controlled diabetes)."
